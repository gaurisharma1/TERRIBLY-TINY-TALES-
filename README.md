# TERRIBLY-TINY-TALES-Assignment

<!-- Create files named index.js App.js and FrequencyCounter.js in src folder of your react app -->

<!-- The dependencies that are included are as follows -->
1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
2. useState: A hook provided by React for adding state to functional components
3. Plotly.js: A JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs
4. react-plotly.js: A React wrapper for Plotly.js that provides a set of React components for creating charts and graphs
5. file-saver: A library that provides an easy way to save files on the client-side. It is used to download the CSV file generated by the "Export" button.

-> Fetching the contents of the specified URL: The fetch() method is employed to retrieve the contents of the URL, and the text() method is utilized to convert the response to text format.

-> Counting the frequency of each word: The FrequencyCounter component processes the text by converting it to lowercase to remove case sensitivity. It replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with spaces to ensure that each word is separated by a space. It then splits the text into an array of words using a space as the delimiter. Any empty strings are filtered out from the array. Finally, the component counts the frequency of each word using a JavaScript object.

-> Sorting and returning the top 20 most occurring words: The component sorts the word frequencies in descending order and returns the top 20 most frequently occurring words as an array.

-> Plotting a histogram of the top 20 most occurring words: The FrequencyCounter component makes use of the react-plotly.js library to produce a histogram of the top 20 most frequent words. It creates a bar chart with the X-axis representing the words and the Y-axis representing the frequency of each word.

-> Exporting the histogram data to a CSV file: The component features an "Export" button that, when clicked, downloads a CSV file of the histogram data. The histogram data is converted to CSV format using the map() and join() methods, a new Blob object with the CSV data and content type is generated, and the file-saver library is utilized to download the CSV file to the user's device.

-> The root component of the application is the App component, which simply renders the FrequencyCounter component.

-> Upon loading the page, the user will see a "Submit" button. When clicked, the FrequencyCounter component fetches the text from the specified URL, counts the frequency of each word, and plots a histogram of the top 20 most occurring words. The user is presented with the histogram and an "Export" button. When the user clicks on the "Export" button, the histogram data is downloaded to their device as a CSV file.
